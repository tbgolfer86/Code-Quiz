  ## Usage
  This app runs in the browser. The user is instructed to press the 'START' button to begin the quiz. Once 'START' is pressed, the timer starts counting down from 60 seconds and the user is presented with a question. When a question is answered incorrectly, time is subtracted from the clock. At the end of the quiz the user can see the final score and is given the option to enter initials to store it on the High Scores list. The user can access the High Scores list by clicking the "View High Scores" button in the top left corner and from there the user can clear the list and go back to the start of the quiz.<br><br>
